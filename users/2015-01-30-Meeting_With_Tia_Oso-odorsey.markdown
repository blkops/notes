###Meeting with Tia Oso, Coordinator of [Black Alliance for Just Immigration](http://www.blackalliance.org/)
#####Feature set:
-------
* Accessibility (Facebook conveniently having issues with posting statuses/censorship)
* Real-time updates contacting all involved (weather causing change in location)
* Organizers being about to control information is important
* Communicating about next steps
* Sharing follow-up information. (What are the demands? Is there going to be a meeting after the protest? Parking information. Creating signs, getting rides)
* People connecting in certain areas
* Way to prevent disconnection
* Keep in mind being welcoming to new protesters
* For volunteering/participating a way to include skills (ability to search for certain events based on skillset)
* Possible way to utilize text-blasts as well? (Something organizers are familiar with)
* Need a way to count how many people are participating 
* Communicating needs is important (First Aid)
* Losing people you go to the protest with (ie. children)/pinging location w/ preset message? (@Dob)

#####Setting up an event steps:
--------
* Choose target/action (smaller groups reach out to trusted individuals; comparison of scope b/w small and large groups is something to consider: what information do they both need?)
* Choose ideal date/time/format
* Put together messaging for why we are putting together this event
* Press release and send information out  via flyer and via city listservs
* Determining if group needs a permit
* [Resource that may be useful in further understanding (@Dob)] (http://www.occupytogether.org/blog/2012/06/15/how-to-organize-a-protest/)

#####What participants want:
--------
* who set up the event (how do I contact the organizer? Making the organizer transparent)
* controlling the messaging

#####What we don’t want:
--------
* An app that keeps all data about someone all in one place
* A social media network (@Jacky)

#####Resources:
------
* Looking at what they’ve done in other locations in similar situations to unify (ie. Arab Spring)
* Bad Apples police reporting app
* [FireChat](http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/hong-kong-protesters-flock-to-off-grid-messaging-app/?_r=0)
* [Arrest app that pings (@Dob) - I’m Getting Arrested:] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.quadrant2.arrested&hl=en)
