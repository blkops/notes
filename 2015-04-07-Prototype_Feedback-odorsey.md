#Prototype 1.0 Feedback
  * Is there an ability to search by date? It would be useful to have that functionality.
  * What wipe and burn features are being considered for security purposes? (Torque, Thread?)
  * Consider advertising the app as an event app so that there will be less of a chance of it getting misused by law enforcement or otherwise. (But we could also suggest #BlackLivesMatter protestors to use it)
  * Consider the basic Android appearance and functionality (Android already has a  back button and has navigation at the bottom of the screen). It might be better to put the menu items on the left-hand side of the screen instead of the bottom where fat fingers can potentially hit things accidentally.
  * It's also useful to think about how Flash Mobs get started (texting everyone who wants to be involved, meeting, coordinating, etc.)
  * Incorpoating Twitter is very interesting in terms of Twitter Chats that occur alongside of events that are hosted by organizations, institutions, etc.
