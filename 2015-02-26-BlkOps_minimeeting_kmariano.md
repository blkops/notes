#On the lack of active engagement and the purpose of blkops

[@miql][] and talked briefly during lunch and some interesting topics came up
regarding blkops, the seeming lack of activist engagement and the feasability
of building the rise-app. This led to a discussion about what should our
overall mission be as an organization.

With the lack of activist engagement in collaborating on rise, [@miql][] echoed
[@jalcine][]'s question on whether building a protest app is feasible when there
seems to be very little active civic engagement going on. I thought that building
the application would be useful for several reasons:

1. It restarts the conversation regarding civil protest.
2. It provides activists technology tools that they can choose to use to aid in
   their activism.
3. Building the tool will give us valuable insights into other possible civic 
   engagement tools that we could build.

My feeling was that we should build the application anyway and that this would probably
not be the only application we build for civic engagement. 

I think that ultimately what I would like the organization to provide people is a way
to enable "a turnkey civil rights movement". We should give activists, artists and
change makers the technical tools they need to get their message out. Some of those
tools could include:

1. Giving them the know-how to encrypt their communications, curate their content or
   platforms where they can broadcast their message.
2. Semantic analysis of local and state records to identify issues that are important.
3. Data analysis on government statistics at every level to highlight issues that
   affect disenfranchised communities. 
4. Creating field guides on how to securely network their communications and open-source
   their engagement practices to make them more effective. 

Ultimately, protesting and raising awareness is the tip of the iceberg.
The real change happens with policy at the local, state and national level.
That means raising awareness on issues in local elections that may affect
communities of color. Empowering people with information on the local political
landscape so voters are informed during elections and can make changes.

**The revolution may not be televised, but it will be pull-requested and merged.** :grin:
