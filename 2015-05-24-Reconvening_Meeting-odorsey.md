##Rise App
- No more Rise protest map app. We're thinking that smaller apps could be more effective.
- Instead, Rise will be the name of a suite of app services that we can add to as we get more ideas for apps.

##Arsire App
- Currently thinking of creating an app to help activists who are getting arrested. The app would automatically create a crowdfunding page where people could donate money to them for their bail. The app would also have a feature to help provide legal representationand information about legal representation.
- @miql said that he would work on starting the information document for this app

## Bot Detection Tool
- Would require figuring out an algorithm to enable trust.
- "we can have people flag accounts and then do machine learning to learn the score" (Koshin)
- "we could ask for block lists from people typically targeted by trolls and use that to build a model of stats (from the non-suspended accounts) just to start off" (Jacky)

## Encrypted Chat App
- "encrypted chat via bluetooth and when you get knocked, it erases all the history" (Koshin)
- "Nothing stored on servers, Peer to peer communications" (Koshin)
- This would probably get done after the Civil Disobedience Toolkit

##Civil Disobedience Toolkit
- Changing the focus to realizing where low-tech is necessary and where high-tech is necessary. We don't need to build several apps, but should think about where gaps need to be filled.
-"What we want is to build a canvas using different tools that empowers activists and organizers." - Koshin
- This is more about "Organizing resource collection for protestersâ€¦food drives, financial donations so that they can keep going etc." (Koshin)
- "So if we put together a civil disobedience resource list [website]... with the applications necessary and educate people on how to encrypt their communications so that it is difficult for surveillance systems to target their communications, we will have done our jobs." (Koshin)
