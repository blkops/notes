#Rise App
- No more Rise protest map app. We're thinking that smaller apps could be more effective.
- Instead, Rise will be the name of a suite of app services that we can add to as we get more ideas for apps.

#Arsire App
- Currently thinking of creating an app to help activists who are getting arrested. The app would automatically create a crowdfunding page where people could donate money to them for their bail. The app would also have a feature to help provide legal representationand information about legal representation.
- @miql said that he would work on starting the information document for this app

#Civil Disobedience Toolkit
- Changing the focus to realizing where low-tech is necessary and where high-tech is necessary. We don't need to build several apps, but should think about where gaps need to be filled.
-"What we want is to build a canvas using different tools that empowers activists and organizers." - Koshin
- This is more about "Organizing resource collection for protestersâ€¦food drives, financial donations so that they can keep going etc." (Koshin)
