# Notes

This repository is meant to hold notes from meetings so people can catch up on
where we left off. Feel free to add by adhering to the format:

    YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-MEETING_NAME-USERNAME.markdown

Note that `HH` and `MM` should be _when_ the meeting started, not necessarily
when you started recording. Also, replace the spaces in the meeting name with
underscores.
