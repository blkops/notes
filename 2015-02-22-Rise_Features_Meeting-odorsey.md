##APIs
* [ActionNetwork](https://actionnetwork.org/docs/v1/events) will be our go-to API. It will nicely handle the bulk of our feature set and the [terms](https://actionnetwork.org/terms) look good because we will own the data.
  * However, we still want to keep an archive of the data just in case something goes wrong. We're thinking [Mongo](http://www.mongodb.org/).
* Facebook + Instagram + Twitter are essential.
