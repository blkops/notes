#Rise 

Rise App
Research using an event  API like  EventBrite
- Would we create events for protests that are already happening (via Ferguson Response Network?) Should we start trying to find ways to scrape or [OCR](http://www.onlineocr.net/) the data from those images? 

Notifications through SMS or Device Push Notifications
- for [Android](https://parse.com/tutorials/android-push-notifications)
- for [iPhone](https://developer.apple.com/notifications/)

Twitter Hashtag integration ([Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public))
 - Would support conversations happening on Twitter and could take a lot of the work out of supporting other needed features such as finding lost participants
 - Would we include ability to login with Twitter as an option instead of logging into user authentication system?

## Organizer 
 - Create an Event 
 - set Event Location
 - set Event duration
 - send Event invitation
 - Automatic Post Notifications to twitter #hashtags
 - View Event Details
 - RSVPs
 - Send Event Notifications (possibly via SMS? Would this help ensure security?)
 
## Activists / Organizers
- Find Event by location, start time, end time, keywords
- Check in to events (research using foursquare or swarm for checkins)
- view events by location and cluster number of people
- weather information ([OpeanWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api))?
