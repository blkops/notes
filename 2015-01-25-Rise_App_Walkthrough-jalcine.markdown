# Rise App Walkthrough

  * Mobile app is [Ionic][] based.
  * Building out an API for other applications to use.
  * Consider working on the API and the mobile application in tandem.

## Protest API

  * Use as basis for all protest.
  * Make users anonymous by default, but toggle to public if necessary.
  * Add concept of verifying users.
  * Make data by default read-only. __Heavy__ moderation of writes will be in
    place.
  * Consider the methodology of handling administrators.
  * **Draft out a schema for data to be collected**.
  * Nuke other repositories to reduce clutter.
  * Consider using Ruby for more places.

## Action Items

  * `rise-web` is now `rise-api`.
